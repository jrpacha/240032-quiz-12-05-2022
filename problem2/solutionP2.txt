		   *** Problem 2 ***
(a) The entry (400,400) of the global stiffness matrix is
    K(400,400) = 4.6750e+00

    Hint1. The value of K(300,300) = 4.072380e+00

(b) The minimum of the values of Q on the left vertical boundary
    is -2.0179e+01

    Hint2. The maximum in absolute value of Q over all the nodes
    is 2.1674e+01

(c) Now consider that the circle exterior boundary is no more
   isolated, but there is a constant flow per unit length qn = 
   -0.40 trought that boundary

   Then, the minimum of the values of Q on the left vertical
   boundary is: -1.8773e+01

   Hint3. The maximum in absolute value of Q over all the nodes
   is 2.0269e+01
